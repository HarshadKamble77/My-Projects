Description: This project involves building a deep learning model to classify different audio files into various categories. The model is trained on a dataset of audio clips to recognize patterns and accurately classify them.

Key Objectives:

Data preprocessing and augmentation
Model building using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Training and evaluation of the model
Deployment of the model for real-time audio classification
Technologies Used:

Python (Librosa, TensorFlow, Keras)
Jupyter Notebook
Deep Learning (CNNs)
Outcome: A trained deep learning model capable of classifying audio files with high accuracy.
