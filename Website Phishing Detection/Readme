Description:
This project involves detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. 
The analysis focuses on identifying malicious websites by examining various URL features and patterns associated with phishing activities.

Key Objectives:
Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and check for class imbalance
Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine variable distributions, correlations, and multicollinearity
Feature extraction from URLs and dimensionality reduction using PCA
Model building using 10 different machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and more
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and reduce overfitting
Model evaluation using various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
Visualization of key insights and model performance metrics

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Neural Networks)
Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Outcome:
An accurate phishing detection model with XGBoost showing the best performance, along with interactive visualizations showcasing feature importance, 
classification results, and actionable insights. 
The project provides a robust framework for phishing detection, 
highlighting the effectiveness of tree-based models and neural networks while identifying limitations in Naive Bayes and SVM for this use case.
