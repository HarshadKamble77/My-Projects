This project aims to predict real estate prices using ensemble machine learning techniques. 
The model is designed to handle various features including -->
property location, size, and age, delivering accurate price predictions to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

Features:-
Data Collection & Cleaning: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring data quality.
Feature Engineering: Added derived features like 'House Age' to enhance model accuracy.
Modeling: Implemented ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for robust predictions.
Dashboard: Developed an interactive web application using Dash to visualize and explore predictions.
Tools & Technologies

Results
Achieved a significant RÂ² score improvement with ensemble methods.
Deployed a user-friendly web interface for real-time price prediction and data exploration.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of ensemble models in real estate price prediction and provides a practical tool for users to analyze property values interactively.
